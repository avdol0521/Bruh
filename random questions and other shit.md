### malware niya ghataghati:
- code obfuscation niya ghataghati korlam. how do i get it into malware analysis/development and malware samples er access paite pari kivabe. malpedia te ghuraghuri korlam but its invite only
- whats tcp tunneling/wrapping? apparently it can be used to bypass network restrictions in fully firewalled environments.
- whats **LIONTAIL**? apparentlyÂ an advanced passive malware framework installed on Windows servers. For stealth purposes, LIONTIAL implants utilize direct calls to Windows HTTP stack driver HTTP.sys to load memory-residents payloads.
- sideloaded DLL? what does it have to do with malware? is it really that undetectable? this is apparently what hackers settled on after they couldnt exploit macros anymore. scarred manticore used dlls in windows servers by taking advantage of missing dll files. he also used http.sys a kernel level driver (doesnt have any documentation). mainly used http.sys IOCTL (device Input and Output Controls)
- apt (advanced persistant threats)??? iranian actors arent apts. or at least they werent considered as such until scarred manticore.
- C2 (command and control)
