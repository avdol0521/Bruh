### Left to Right Across a Period:

1. **[[Atomic radius]]**: Decreases. 
2. **[[Ionization energy]]: Increases.
3. **[[Electronegativity]]**: Increases.
4. **[[Electron affinity]]**: Becomes more negative (increases tendency to gain electrons).
5. **[[Metallic character]]**: Decreases.
6. **[[melting and boiling points]] and [[boiling point]]**: Generally increase up to Group 14, then decrease towards Group 18 (highest around the center).

### Top to Bottom in a Group:

1. **[[Atomic radius]]**: Increases.
2. **[[Ionization energy]]**: Decreases.
3. **[[Electronegativity]]**: Decreases.
4. **[[Electron Affinity]]**: Becomes less negative.
5. **[[Metallic character]]**: Increases.
6. **[[melting and boiling points]]** : Vary, but tend to decrease for nonmetals and increase for metals

### Exceptions:

1. **[[Ionization energy]]**: Irregularities in Groups 2, 15, and 18 (full/half-full stability).
2. **[[Electron Affinity]]**: Group 2, 15, and 18 have less negative values than expected.
3. **[[Electronegativity]]**: Noble gases (Group 18) are often excluded.
