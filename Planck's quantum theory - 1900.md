# Main proposal:
[[Max Planck]]'s quantum theory states that matter can only emit or absorb energy in discrete quantities, or packets, called [[Quanta]]: 
## Some details:
- **Energy is quantized**: Energy can only be transferred in specific amounts, or quanta.
- **Energy is proportional to frequency**: The energy of a quantum is directly proportional to the frequency of the radiation. 
- **Light quanta are called photons**: In the case of light, a quantum is called a photon.
- **reason of publication:** to explain [[Blackbody radiation]] 
- wasnt really accepted until after bohr used it to calculate spectral line positions in 1913
