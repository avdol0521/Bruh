# Definition:
- **Electron Affinity**: Energy change when an atom gains an electron in its gaseous state.
- key point: The energy change when an atom _gains_ an electron (usually negative, as energy is released).
## Some questions:
- Why is [[O - Oxygen]]s 1st [[Electron Affinity]] positive but the 2nd negative?
	- **Ans:** **Oxygen's first electron affinity is negative** because energy is released when an electron is added to form a stable O⁻ ion. The **second is positive** because adding another electron to O⁻ (already negatively charged) requires extra energy to overcome the repulsion between negative charges.
