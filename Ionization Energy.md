# Definition:
- **Ionization Energy**: Energy required to remove an electron from an atom in its gaseous state.
- key point: **Ionization Energy**: The energy required to _remove_ an electron from an atom (always positive, as energy is needed).

## Some questions:
- why is [[O - Oxygen]]s 2nd [[Ionization Energy]] energy greater than [[N - Nitrogen]]s 2nd [[Ionization Energy]]
	- **Ans:** The second ionization energy is the energy needed to remove a second electron after the first has already been removed.
		
		For **oxygen**, after losing one electron, it becomes O⁺, which has 8 protons attracting the remaining 7 electrons. This strong nuclear charge pulls the remaining electrons closer, increasing the energy needed to remove the second electron.
		
		For **nitrogen**, after losing one electron, it becomes N⁺, with 7 protons attracting the remaining 6 electrons. Since there are fewer protons compared to oxygen, the attraction on the remaining electrons is weaker, requiring less energy to remove the second electron.
		
	So, oxygen’s greater nuclear charge (8 protons vs. 7) makes its second ionization energy higher than nitrogen's.
