## Definition
Van der Waals forces are weak intermolecular forces that significantly influence the physical properties of substances, especially nonpolar and slightly polar ones. Here's how they affect various properties:

### Key Factors Influencing Van der Waals Forces:
1. **Molecular Size**: Larger molecules have stronger van der Waals forces because they have more electrons and a larger surface area for interactions.  
2. **Shape**: Long, linear molecules have stronger van der Waals forces than compact, spherical ones because of more effective surface contact.  
	- example: [[C - Carbon]] has a really high vanderwalls force because it forms really long chains

### Effects on Properties:
1. **Boiling and Melting Points**:  
   - Substances with stronger van der Waals forces (e.g., larger molecules or those with more surface area) have higher boiling and melting points.  
   - Weak van der Waals forces in smaller or spherical molecules lead to lower boiling and melting points.  

2. **Physical States**:  
   - Weak van der Waals forces lead to gases at room temperature (e.g., noble gases).  
   - Stronger van der Waals forces can turn similar molecules into liquids or solids (e.g., iodine is solid due to stronger forces).  

3. **Solubility**:  
   - Nonpolar substances, dominated by van der Waals forces, dissolve in nonpolar solvents but not in polar ones due to mismatched intermolecular interactions.  

4. **Viscosity**:  
   - Higher van der Waals forces increase viscosity in liquids by resisting flow.  

5. **Surface Tension**:  
   - Molecules with stronger van der Waals forces tend to have higher surface tension since their intermolecular attractions hold them together more tightly.  

6. **Molecular Packing**:  
   - Stronger van der Waals forces promote better packing of molecules in solids, leading to higher density.  




Van der Waals forces are essential in explaining why some substances are liquid or solid under certain conditions, even without strong polar bonds or hydrogen bonding. :)
