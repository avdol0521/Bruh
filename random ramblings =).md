- i got lost chasing perfection. and forgot that it doesnt exist. went down a rabbit hole. started comparing myself and kind of wend down a downward spiral. forgot what really matters to me, happiness. forgot the whole point of that bucket list was happiness, and that it comes in all shapes and sizes. and mine doesnt have to be that massive :)

- one of the reasons i said no was because i needed to prove to myself that i could stay consistent on one thing coz asso couldnt stay consistent and i needed to prove to myself that ill never turn into asso coz its one of my biggest fears. but i now realise that just one thing is unreasonable and unrealistic to begin with, i actually need to maintain a balance of consistency on alot of things at one. thats part of why i failed at first. not that im not failing right now. one of my initial approaches to staying consistent on one thing was brute forcing it. like forcing myself to do a set amount of that specific thing every single day no matter what. but turns out i cant do that coz burnout is a thing and hyperfocus doesnt last forever, and with with my adhd i cant really stay focused on one thing and end up getting interested by something else and focusing on that and repeating the whole cycle all while losing progress on the previous thing and the consistency on it and feeling like shit about it. so what i tried next was make a list of things ill do a set amount everyday no matter what. and i built an entire tracking system in obsidian through the daily notes feature and some plugins. but turns out that doesnt actually solve the previous problem and actually makes it worse with it still being forcing myself on a repetitive grind everyday and burnout still existing (i wish it wasnt a thing smh) plus my dumbass piling EVEN MORE STUFF on top of the already clogged daily routine i made. so i still lost progress after a while and felt like shit about it. so the solution i came up now as im writing this (7/12/2024) is keeping a list of all the things im supposed to do consistently and focus on just one of those things a day. that way i dont force myself to do the same thing every single fucking day and speedrun to burnout. plus i made another section in my obsidian vault to keep track of all the things that interest me (side quests) so i can get back to them later when i have free time so that solved my getting distracted problem i guess. i still dont know if it did coz its the first day i've implemented this as im writing this. i dont even know why im writing this. no one will ever see this shit(probably). one of the other things that really held me back before the stuff written in this section happened was my perception of "consistency" was fucked up. well thats wrong it was during the beggining of this section that this shit was holding me back. and that perception of consistency was that i thought i had to do a thing every single day no matter what for it to count as consistency. i didnt realise that a few days of gaps in between as breaks for other stuff in life was actually a good thing and that those breaks helped prevent burnout. so i'd end up accidentally breaking my endless toxic streaks and then feel fucked up about not being able to be consistent for more than a month or so (damn who tf forces themselves to do the same thing every single fucking day for more than a month that was so toxic of me to myself) and i'd hate myself over it. so yea self hatred was also a thing ig. and that kinda led to my subconcious thinking im not worthy of the things life gives me. and add the whole being afraid to lose the new found "stability" and surrounding myself with only what i already knew and pushing new experiences and people away and me being awkward and not knowing how to talk about whats on my mind to the mix and now you get why i did what i did
